Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load — automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy.

As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":2067,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1622132709","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":449,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1622132711","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":353,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1622132713","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":317,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6782,"reviewCount":322,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1720185585000},{"id":"langpack-de@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"name":"Language: Deutsch (German)","version":"130.0.20240807.91924","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4332998/deutsch_de_language_pack-130.0.20240807.91924.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deutsch-de-language-pack/","description":"Firefox Language Pack for Deutsch (de) – German","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":627,"type":"locale","creator":{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4757633/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1526,"reviewCount":238,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deutsch-de-language-pack/reviews/","updateDate":1723037550000},{"id":"{036a55b4-5e72-4d05-a06c-cba2dfcc134a}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2623/2623538-32.png?modified=8be60eed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2623/2623538-64.png?modified=8be60eed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2623/2623538-128.png?modified=8be60eed"},"name":"TWP - Translate Web Pages","version":"10.0.1.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4245500/traduzir_paginas_web-10.0.1.1.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/traduzir-paginas-web/","description":"Translate your page in real time using Google or Yandex.\nIt is not necessary to open new tabs.\nNow works with the NoScript Extension.","fullDescription":"What can this extension do?\n\n    Your current page is translated without having to open new tabs.\n    It is possible to change the translation language.\n    You can select to automatically translate.\n    To change the translation engine just touch the Google Translate icon. \n\nWhy do you need to access your data on all the websites you visit?\nTo translate any website it is necessary to access and modify the text of the web pages.

And it can map a same key sequence to different commands for different websites (and/or for different active elements in page).\n\nFor example:\n* press `f` to hint all clickable elements of the current web page\n* press `o` to show a search panel (\"Vomnibar\", a safe iframe) to search in your history, bookmarks, opened tabs and configured search engines, and you can even remove a history or tab by selecting a search result and pressing Shift+Delete\n* press j, k, h, l to scroll down/up/left/right on web pages\n* press \"/\" to search for text; press \"v\" to enter Visual Mode (just like VIM)\n* press Shift+J, Shift+K, `g0`, `g$` to switch to the previous/next/first/last tab\n* press `x` to remove a tab, and Shift+X to restore recently closed tabs (sessions), and many other commands\n* command repetition: for example, pressing `5X` (`5`, Shift+X) will restore 5 recent closed tabs\n* configure key mappings to bind Vimium C's tens of commands to other key sequences, and add options to switch command behaviors\n* apply block lists and allow lists of key mappings on configurable special websites and URLs\n\nIt can copy any selected text and current tab's title and URL to the system clipboard, and read the clipboard to search the copied text using a specified search engine.\n\nIt can also enable/disable websites' image loading and even JavaScript execution, if you trigger its command \"toggleCS\". This functionality requires a permission of \"Change your settings that control websites' access to features such as cookies, JavaScript ...\", and Vimium C promises that it won't do any thing secretly, but only act on what key sequences you press.\n\nIt will provide 8 \"global\" browser shortcuts: createTab, previousTab, nextTab, reloadTab, and some others, so you may bind some key sequences to them, and then these commands will work even when a page has no focus (e.g. when the browser address bar is focused).\n\nIt will register an omnibox keyword \"v\", and if you input \"v\" and press Space on the browser address bar (omnibox), you can do searches for history, bookmarks and tabs just like you're inputting on its Vomnibar.\n\nIt supports encoded URLs, and you can search Chinese, Japanese and Korean words in URLs of history and bookmarks. You may configure it to decode URLs in a charset of your locale .\n\nIt will download all synced settings from the Internet during the first installation, and you may enable/disable the syncing on certain computers.\n\nIf you have any exclusion rule for key mappings, it will monitor browser tab URL changes to re-check whether a new URL matches your URL pattern list.\n\nVimium C may show a notification when it gets upgraded to a new minor version.\n\nFor more information about release notes, rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium C's features, please see here: https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#readme , or https://gitee.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#git-readme .

They however only mark recently seen videos, which is kind of disappointing. This addon fixes this issue and keeps track of your entire watch history, such that not only the recently seen videos are being marked.\n\nDoes this work with the old Youtube theme? I am afraid that only the new theme is supported. If you do not know which theme you are currently using then it is very likely the new one.\n\nHow can the persistence of the database be ensured? There is an export and import feature, which makes it easy to create a backup of the history. This backup can easily be archived such that you can ensure that you never lose your history.\n\nHow can I make sure that the database is complete? The automatic synchronization only considers the recent activity. You are thus encouraged to manually initiate a complete synchronization in the settings, which incorporates as much of your history as possible.\n\nSomething is broken, I demand a fix!

The hotkeys and functionality are inspired by MPC-HC's Pan and Scan Rotate system and are fully customizable from the extension's settings page. These transformations are useful for fixing black bars via resizing the video (Zoom), correcting aspect ratios (Stretch) to make video full-screen, GoPro or POV (Point of View) or head mounted video perspectives (Flip aka Mirror, or Rotate).\n\nThese transformations will also work in full-screen.\n\nTransformations Include:\n✔ Zooming (in and out)\n✔ Stretching (vertically and horizontally)\n✔ Positional Movement (up/down/left/right)\n✔ Rotation (clockwise ↻ and counter-clockwise ↺)\n✔ Flipping/Mirroring (horizontally and vertically)\n\nDemonstration Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKdVvSD7y5o\n\nYou can also combine transformations. For example, you can zoom in on a specific area by using Zoom and Positional Movement.\n\nSupported Websites:\n✔ YouTube™\n✔ Vimeo\n✔ Dailymotion\n✔ Bilibili B站\n✔ And many more, though this extension is targeting user uploaded videos that need tweaking.\n\n✅ To get started, go to a webpage with a video playing on it.\nThen try the hotkeys below.\n\n⚙️ Customizability:\n▸ You can add, modify or delete any hotkey for any transformation operation via the extension's settings page.\n▸ You can modify the amount of scaling (zoom/stretching), rotation, or positional movement in the settings page too.\n\nDefault Hotkeys:\n▸ Numpad 5 to reset all transformations back to the original\n▸ Numpad 9 / Numpad 1 to zoom in/out\n▸ Numpad 8 / Numpad 2 to stretch / compress vertically\n▸ Numpad 6 / Numpad 4 to stretch / compress horizontally\n▸ Ctrl + Numpad direction (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) to move the element\n▸ Ctrl + Numpad 5 to recenter the element\n▸ Alt + Numpad 1 / Alt + Numpad 3 to rotate ↻ / ↺\n▸ Alt + Numpad 2 / Alt + Numpad 8 to flip vertically\n▸ Alt + Numpad 4 / Alt + Numpad 6 to flip horizontally\n▸ Alt + Numpad 7 / Alt + Numpad 9 to rotate 90 degrees ↻ / ↺\n▸ Alt + U will toggle on and off all of the hotkeys above or switch to Video mode\n▸ Alt + I will toggle on and off all of the hotkeys above or switch to Image mode\n\nAlternative Hotkeys (please note that these have changed recently in the 2.0 release):\n(Note: For compact keyboards without a numpad like on laptops, and some mac keyboards. Enabled via a checkbox in the popup action options.)\n▸ Shift + Arrow Left / Shift + Arrow Right to reset all transformations back to the original\n▸ Shift + Arrow Up / Shift + Arrow Down to zoom in / out\n▸ Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Right / Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Left to stretch / compress horizontally\n▸ Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Up / Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Down to stretch / compress vertically\n▸ Ctrl + Arrow direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the element\n▸ Alt + Arrow Left / Alt + Arrow Right to rotate ↻ / ↺\n▸ Shift + Alt + Arrow Left / Shift + Alt + Arrow Right to rotate 90 degrees ↻ / ↺\n▸ Alt + Arrow Up to flip vertically\n▸ Alt + Arrow Down to flip horizontally\n\nNew Hotkey Preset Available:\n▸ H5Player\n\n✔ Image transformations are now supported! ✔\n\n✅ You can also transform images with Alt + I.\n\n⚠️ Troubleshooting and Notes:\n▸ Garbled, corrupted, or missing video after a transformation? If possible try a different resolution/quality, otherwise try disabling hardware acceleration in your browser settings (then closing and re-opening the browser).\n▸ Some sites may load a thumbnail of a video and not load the actual video, so you may need to start the video first before attempting to do video transforms.\n▸ This extension tries to override browser and website shortcuts like Ctrl + Numpad 5 on YouTube. You may need to toggle off the hotkeys to use the overridden keys normally, for example using the numpad to type numbers into an input field.\n▸ Sometimes I've noticed that I have to click away from a video or the address bar/top portion of the browser (to any content area on the page) to get hotkeys working. I suspect I could be pressing Alt (activating the borwser menu) or selecting the browser interface which is then trapping the keypress events instead of the page.\n▸ Feature requests and bug reports are welcome.\n▸ I'm still actively developing this extension to make it the best that I can.
