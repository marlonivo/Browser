The arkenfox user.js is a template which aims to provide as much privacy and enhanced security as possible, and to reduce tracking and fingerprinting as much as possible - while minimizing any loss of functionality and breakage (but it will happen).

Everyone, experts included, should at least read the wiki, as it contains important information regarding a few user.js settings. There is also an interactive current release, thanks to icpantsparti2.
